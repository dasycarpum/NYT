@abstract: Python defines two types of packages, regular packages and namespace packages. Regular packages are traditional packages as they existed in Python 3. A regular package is typically implemented as a directory containing an __init__.py file. When a regular package is imported, this __init__.py file is implicitly executed, and the objects it defines are bound to names in the packageâ€™s namespace. The __init__.py file can contain the same Python code that any other module can contain, and Python will add some additional attributes to the module when it is imported.
